The Reasonable Randomizer is a Java program that can modify
the starter pokemon, wild pokemon, trainer pokemon and movesets
of any pokemon game from the 3rd gen. It works with FireRed,
LeafGreen, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire, and with English, Japanese
and French ROMs. The Reasonable Randomizer is different from
other randomization programs in that it offers options for
limited randomization, which means it won't simply pick any
random pokemon from Bulbasaur to Deoxys, but instead limits the
random pokemon to choose from based on factors such as
evolution state, pokemon strength, pokemon habitat, and type
specialties. This randomizer also allows you to choose between
basic and advanced random movesets.

New in version 1.2 - 3-stage starters, starter type trios, all pokemon in wild, and no shadow tag pokemon (thanks to deoxys for suggesting this feature) options. I've also implemented an obedience check removal for mew and deoxys (thanks to compiling, who informed me of this), gym trainer type specialties, and the rival having different pokemon based on your starter choice.
